# Student_Marks_Dataset
The objective of this project is to perform the Kaggle challenge: **Student Marks Dataset** ("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/student-marks-dataset").

**ABOUT CHALLENGE**:

Description:

The data consists of Marks of students including their study time & number of courses. The dataset is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Properties of the Dataset: \
Number of Instances: 100\
Number of Attributes: 3 including the target variable.

The project is simple yet challenging as it is has very limited features & samples. Can you build regression model to capture all the patterns in the dataset, also maitaining the generalisability of the model?

Objective:

    - Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).
    - Build Regression models to predict the student marks wrt multiple features.
    - Also evaluate the models & compare their respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.




**The results thrown by the realization of the project can be seen in ***student_marks.ipynb*****
